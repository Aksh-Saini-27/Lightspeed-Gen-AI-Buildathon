SimuData:
A Generative AI Solution for Synthetic Medical Imaging Data

Overview
SimuData: MedTech tackles the critical challenge of accessing high-quality medical imaging data by leveraging advanced generative AI techniques. Due to privacy concerns and strict data laws, it is increasingly difficult to obtain real-world datasets for research and clinical applications. Our solution uses cutting-edge diffusion models and federated learning to synthesize anonymized medical images that preserve diagnostic value. In addition, we have developed innovative image analysis tools—including CT-MRI interconversion and precise segmentation—to empower next-generation healthcare diagnostics and research.

Key Features
Synthetic Medical Image Generation

Utilizes diffusion models, including Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), to generate realistic synthetic images.

Implements a Personalized Federated Diffusion Model (PFDM) framework that combines federated learning with a reverse diffusion process to balance global generalization and client-specific refinements.

Ensures data privacy through differential privacy inherent in the noisy diffusion process.

CT & MRI Scan Interconversion

Uses advanced deep learning techniques (e.g., score-matching models) to synthesize CT images from MRI data and vice versa.

Incorporates multiple sampling strategies (Euler-Maruyama, Predictor-Corrector, Probability Flow ODE) to produce high-quality images that support enhanced diagnostic workflows.

Medical Imaging Segmentation & Analysis

Introduces HiDiff—a hybrid diffusion framework achieving accurate segmentation by integrating discriminative and generative approaches.

Employs a Bernoulli-based diffusion kernel optimized for discrete segmentation tasks, ensuring effective identification of critical features such as tumor regions.

Anonymized Data Repositories

Creates secure, shareable repositories of synthetic radiology data for collaborative research without compromising patient confidentiality.

User-Friendly UI/UX & Database Handling

Features an interactive web interface built using Streamlit, integrating dataset search capabilities, image upload functions, synthetic simulation, and an NLP-based Llama search engine for intelligent dataset querying.

Manages synthetic datasets within a classic database system to ensure seamless data handling.

Project Architecture
PFDM for Dataset Synthesis
Forward Diffusion Process: Each client locally adds controlled noise to their dataset to obfuscate sensitive information before data is shared.

Reverse Diffusion Process: Split into global (shared across all clients) and client-specific (personalized) components. This allows the global model to learn generalizable patterns while preserving unique, non-sensitive details via local training.

Privacy by Design: The inherent noise in the diffusion process provides differential privacy, reducing the risk of sensitive data exposure.

Application Models
CT/MRI Interconversion: Enables cross-modality image synthesis, making it cost-effective and efficient to generate missing imaging modalities while preserving diagnostic details.

Scan Segmentation: The HiDiff framework accurately segments critical regions in CT/MRI scans, even for small or ambiguous structures, thereby augmenting clinical decision-making.
